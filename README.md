## Emotions in Voice Analysis for Interviews

## PRAAT

- **Number of Syllables:**
  - Indicates the total count of syllables in the voice recording.

- **Number of Pauses:**
  - Represents the total count of pauses made during the recording.
  - An increased number of pauses may suggest hesitation, uncertainty, or nervousness during the speech.

- **Rate of Speech:**
  - Reflects the speed at which the speaker is talking. It is often measured in syllables per second.

- **Articulation Rate:**
  - Measures the speed or rate at which the speaker articulates words, indicating clarity of speech.
  - A slower articulation rate could indicate that the speaker is carefully choosing their words, potentially due to confusion or nervousness.

- **Speaking Duration:**
  - Denotes the total duration of the actual speech in the recording (excluding pauses).
  - A shorter speaking duration relative to the original duration might suggest hesitation, difficulty expressing thoughts, or nervousness.

- **Original Duration:**
  - Represents the total duration of the entire recording, including pauses and periods of silence.

- **Balance:**
  - A ratio indicating the balance between speaking duration and the original duration, suggesting the percentage of time spent in actual speech.
  - A lower balance value might indicate that a significant portion of the recording involves pauses or silence, which could be associated with nervousness or confusion.

- **F0 Mean:**
  - Global mean of the fundamental frequency distribution, representing the average pitch of the speaker's voice.

- **F0 Std (Standard Deviation):**
  - Global standard deviation of the fundamental frequency distribution, indicating the variability in pitch.

- **F0 Median:**
  - Global median of the fundamental frequency distribution, representing the middle point in the pitch values.

- **F0 Min:**
  - Global minimum of the fundamental frequency distribution, indicating the lowest pitch.

- **F0 Max:**
  - Global maximum of the fundamental frequency distribution, indicating the highest pitch.

- **F0 Quantile 25:**
  - Global 25th quantile of the fundamental frequency distribution, representing the pitch value below which 25% of the data falls.

- **F0 Quantile 75:**
  - Global 75th quantile of the fundamental frequency distribution, representing the pitch value below which 75% of the data falls.

### 1. Confident:



- **Number of Syllables:**
  - A moderate count, reflecting a steady and deliberate pace.

- **Number of Pauses:**
  - Fewer pauses indicate a smooth and assured delivery.

- **Rate of Speech:**
  - Moderate and steady speech rate suggests confidence.

- **Articulation Rate:**
  - Clear and balanced articulation rate demonstrates confident expression.

- **Speaking Duration:**
  - Consistent and substantial duration without excessive pauses.

- **Original Duration:**
  - Well-balanced overall duration, with a significant portion dedicated to confident speech.

- **Balance:**
  - A higher balance value indicates a large part of the recording is filled with confident speech.

- **F0 Mean, F0 Std, F0 Median, F0 Min, F0 Max:**
  - Stable and controlled fundamental frequency.

- **F0 Quantile 25, F0 Quantile 75:**
  - Limited pitch variation within certain quantiles suggests confidence in tone.

- **F0 Variability:**
  - Lower variability in fundamental frequency associated with a composed and confident demeanor.

#### Summary
- **Number of Syllables:** A moderate count.
- **Number of Pauses:** Fewer pauses.
- **Rate of Speech:** Moderate and steady.
- **Articulation Rate:** Clear and balanced.
- **Speaking Duration:** Consistent and substantial.
- **Original Duration:** Well-balanced.
- **Balance:** Higher value.
- **F0 Mean, F0 Std, F0 Median, F0 Min, F0 Max:** Stable and controlled.
- **F0 Quantile 25, F0 Quantile 75:** Limited pitch variation.
- **F0 Variability:** Lower variability.


### 2. Nervousness and Confusion:

- **Number of Syllables:**
  - Indicates the total count of syllables in the voice recording.

- **Number of Pauses:**
  - Represents the total count of pauses made during the recording, potentially indicating hesitation or nervousness.

- **Rate of Speech:**
  - Reflects the speed at which the speaker is talking, with a slower rate possibly indicating confusion or nervousness.

- **Articulation Rate:**
  - Measures the speed or rate at which the speaker articulates words, with a slower rate potentially indicating careful word choice due to confusion or nervousness.

- **Speaking Duration:**
  - Denotes the total duration of the actual speech in the recording, with a shorter duration relative to the original possibly suggesting difficulty expressing thoughts or nervousness.

- **Original Duration:**
  - Represents the total duration of the entire recording, including pauses, with a lower balance value possibly associated with nervousness or confusion.

- **Balance:**
  - A ratio indicating the balance between speaking duration and the original duration, with a lower value suggesting a significant portion involves pauses or silence, potentially indicating nervousness or confusion.

- **F0 Mean, F0 Std, F0 Median, F0 Min, F0 Max:**
  - Provide information about the fundamental frequency (pitch) characteristics of the speaker's voice.

- **F0 Quantile 25, F0 Quantile 75:**
  - Represent specific percentiles of the fundamental frequency distribution, indicating pitch variation.

- **F0 Variability:**
  - Higher variability in fundamental frequency could suggest emotional changes, potentially reflecting nervousness.

#### Summary

- **Number of Syllables:** Moderate to high count may indicate uncertainty or hesitation.
- **Number of Pauses:** Increased pauses may suggest nervousness, hesitation, or difficulty expressing thoughts.
- **Rate of Speech:** Slower rate might reflect nervousness or confusion.
- **Articulation Rate:** Slower articulation rate could indicate careful word choice, potentially due to confusion or nervousness.
- **Speaking Duration:** Shorter speaking duration relative to the original duration may suggest hesitation or difficulty expressing thoughts.
- **Original Duration:** Longer total duration with a lower balance value may indicate a significant portion involving pauses or silence, potentially associated with nervousness or confusion.
- **Balance:** Lower balance value might suggest a substantial part of the recording involves pauses or silence.
- **F0 Mean, F0 Std, F0 Median, F0 Min, F0 Max:** Variable fundamental frequency characteristics may reflect emotional changes, potentially indicating nervousness.
- **F0 Quantile 25, F0 Quantile 75:** Pitch variations within certain quantiles may be more pronounced.
- **F0 Variability:** Higher variability in fundamental frequency may suggest emotional changes, reflecting nervousness.


### 3. Other Emotions:

#### Excitement:

- Higher rate of speech, increased articulation rate, and potential pitch variations could indicate excitement.

#### Calmness:

- Steady rate of speech, clear articulation, and a stable fundamental frequency may suggest a calm and composed state.
